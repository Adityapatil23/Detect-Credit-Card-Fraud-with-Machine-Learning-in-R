# Detect-Credit-Card-Fraud-with-Machine-Learning-in-R
This repository demonstrates how to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques in R. Credit card fraud detection is crucial for ensuring financial security, and this project aims to build models that can identify fraudulent transactions based on transaction data.
Project Overview
Globally, there is increasing worry over credit card theft, and machine learning offers a potent tool for spotting fraudulent tendencies. In this research, we develop a classification model that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or valid using supervised learning methods. Preprocessing the data, scaling the features, training the model, and evaluating the result are the steps.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing features, and addressing class imbalance.
Data Splitting: Using an 80/20 train-test split to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Modeling: Training multiple machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to handle imbalanced classes effectively.
